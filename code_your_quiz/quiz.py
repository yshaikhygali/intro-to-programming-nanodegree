A __1__ creates a new type where objects are instances of the class.
 Variables that belong to an object or class are referred to as __2__.
 Objects can also have functionality by using functions that belong to a class.
 Such functions are called __3__ of the class.

ways this is achieved is through the __2__ mechanism. Itâ€™s important to note
that child classes override or extend the functionality (e.g., attributes and
behaviors) of __3__ classes.
