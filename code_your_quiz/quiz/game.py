easy_questions = """Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object oriented programming.
A __1__ creates a new type where objects are instances of the class.
 Variables that belong to an object or class are referred to as __2__.
 Objects can also have functionality by using functions that belong to a class.
 Such functions are called __3__ of the class. __4__ is a class variable or
 instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects.
"""

medium_questions = """Collectively, the fields and methods can be referred to as
the __1__ of that class. Fields are of two types - they can belong to each
instance/object of the class or they can belong to the class itself.
They are called __2__ and __3__ respectively. __4__ is an individual object
of a certain class.
"""

hard_questions = """The __init__ method is run as soon as an object of a class is
instantiated (i.e. created). The method is useful to do any __1__. One of the
major benefits of object oriented programming is reuse of code and one of the
ways this is achieved is through the __2__ mechanism. Itâ€™s important to note
that child classes override or extend the functionality (e.g., attributes and
behaviors) of __3__ classes. __4__ is the assignment of more than one function
to a particular operator.
