                A data engineer is responsible for building and maintaining the data
                architecture of a data science project. These engineers have to ensure
                that there is uninterrupted flow of data between servers and applications.
                Some of the responsibilities of a data engineer include improving
                data foundational procedures, integrating new data management technologies
                and softwares into the existing system, building data collection pipelines,
                among various other things.
