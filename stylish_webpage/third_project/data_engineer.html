			<p class="description">
                A data engineer is responsible for building and maintaining the data
                architecture of a data science project. These engineers have to ensure
                that there is uninterrupted flow of data between servers and applications.
                Some of the responsibilities of a data engineer include improving
                data foundational procedures, integrating new data management technologies
                and softwares into the existing system, building data collection pipelines,
                among various other things.

			<img src="images/dsvsde.png" alt="Who is The Difference between a Data Scientist and a Data Enginee" height="150" width="240">
			<p>Broadly speaking, a data scientist builds models using a combination of statistics,
				mathematics, machine learning and domain based knowledge. He/she has to code and
				build these models using the same tools/languages and framework that the organization supports.</p>
            <p>A data engineer on the other hand has to build and maintain data structures and architectures
				for data ingestion, processing, and deployment for large-scale data-intensive applications.
				To build a pipeline for data collection and storage, to funnel the data to the data scientists,
				to put the model into production – these are just some of the tasks a data engineer has to perform.</p>
